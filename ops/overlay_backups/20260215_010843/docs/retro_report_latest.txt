[RETRO] Turning Point: PR77 baseline reset → restore PR39–PR80+ → provable parity

1) Problem
- main/history and Vercel deployment state were confusing; needed deterministic recovery path.

2) Key moves that fixed it
- Backup before risky ops (backup branch/tag).
- Hard reset main back to known baseline (PR77) + force-with-lease.
- Restore missing feature-set via replay PR79/80/81 and merge as PR83.
- Verification shifted from “merge message counts” to “evidence-based gates”:
  build ✅, must-have paths, PROD /api/version commitSha match, telemetry health ok.

3) Pitfalls hit (and new rules)
- PS5.1: ternary ? : is NOT supported → always if/else.
- PowerShell treats [] in paths as wildcard → use -LiteralPath.
- Invoke-WebRequest can prompt security warning → always -UseBasicParsing.
- git log --merges can miss squash merges → do not use it as feature completeness proof.

4) Outcome
- Local build ✅
- Prod commitSha == HEAD ✅
- Telemetry health ok ✅
- SOP updated + overlay zip created (contains gpt_prompt_next_chat_latest.txt as source of truth).
