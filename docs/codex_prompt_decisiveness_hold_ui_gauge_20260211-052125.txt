[PR GOAL]
Solve: "保留が多すぎて役に立たない" perception AND actually reduce HOLD rate in a transparent, user-controlled way.
Do BOTH in one PR:
(A) UI: de-duplicate verdict, make hero & gauge pointer more prominent, reduce harsh X.
(B) Logic: Add “決め切り度” (慎重/標準/即決) to shrink/expand HOLD band; add /history summary counts.

[NON-NEGOTIABLE]
- Must pass `npm run build`.
- Minimal diff, no unrelated refactors.
- Default behavior must remain identical to current (標準 = current).
- App Router + TypeScript. Keep styling consistent with existing approach.

========================================
A) UI IMPROVEMENTS (Result screen)
========================================
Target: result page UI on mobile.
1) Hero (top headline area)
- Make the main headline more prominent (font size/weight/spacing/contrast).
- Keep dark mode readable (use existing theme tokens; avoid pure red text).
- Remove redundant chip "判定：保留" (keep 信頼度 chip; optional: keep 傾き chip).
- Keep “別の言い方” accordion.

2) Reduce repetition below
- The lower "診断結果 / 保留" area feels repetitive/heavy.
- Shrink the big "保留" text there OR change that card title to something like "判定の詳細" / "傾き" / "根拠" so we don't say "診断結果" twice.
- If there is a large red X icon for HOLD: significantly reduce its size/visual weight.
  Prefer a neutral icon for HOLD (⏸ / … / △) instead of ✕, because ✕ reads like "やめる".
  If keeping ✕, it must look subtle and not dominant.

3) Make gauge pointer more prominent
- Increase pointer triangle size + contrast.
- Add a thin vertical marker line at the pointer position (optional but recommended).
- Ensure labels remain readable on mobile.

========================================
B) DECISIVENESS (Hold-band control) + HISTORY SUMMARY
========================================
Goal: Reduce HOLD frequency without breaking neutrality by making it USER-CONTROLLED and transparent.

1) Add setting: 決め切り度 (3 levels)
- 慎重 / 標準 / 即決
- Default: 標準
- Persist in localStorage.
- Place control in the earliest reasonable place (home or flow start) with minimal UI:
  segmented control or small selector.
- Show chosen level on result page (small note): "決め切り度: 標準（変更可）" for transparency.

2) Engine change (minimal, safe)
- Locate verdict mapping logic (score/tilt -> やめる/保留/買う).
- Implement HOLD band scaling using multipliers:
  慎重: 1.25
  標準: 1.00 (must match current)
  即決: 0.75
- Additionally incorporate mode:
  urgent mode => smaller HOLD band than long mode
  (Example multipliers: urgent 0.85, standard 1.00, long 1.10)
- Combine as: holdBand = baseHoldBand * decisivenessMultiplier * modeMultiplier
- Backward compatibility: if old runs missing fields, treat as 標準.

3) Persist per run (recommended)
- Store selected 決め切り度 and mode in the saved run record so history can summarize accurately.

4) /history summary
- Add a simple summary at top:
  counts of verdicts: 買う / 保留 / やめる + percentages.
- Optional: show counts grouped by 決め切り度 (if stored per run), but keep minimal.

========================================
Acceptance checklist
========================================
- `npm run build` passes.
- On iPhone viewport:
  - Hero headline is clearly primary.
  - First screen shows fewer repeated "保留" (no redundant 判定 chip).
  - Gauge pointer is visible at a glance.
- With 決め切り度=即決, HOLD rate decreases vs 標準 for similar inputs (verify via /history summary).
