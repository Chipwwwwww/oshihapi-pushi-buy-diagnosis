PR Goal
- Make StyleMode (ver0=standard / ver1=kawaii / ver2=oshi) visible from the HOME page.
- StyleMode must affect:
  1) Home UI microcopy
  2) Flow question prompt + option labels (copy only)
  3) Result explanation/advice/share text (copy only)
- IMPORTANT INVARIANT:
  - StyleMode must NOT change decision semantics (BUY/WAIT/SKIP meaning), reasonTags meaning, or nextActions meaning.
  - At MVP, logic can stay the same; only copy changes. (Future PR can extend logic.)
- Must pass: npm run build ✅

Single source of truth to use
- docs/mode_copy_spec_latest.md
- src/oshihapi/modes/style_copy_dictionary.ts
- (existing) src/oshihapi/modes/mode_dictionary.ts (if you already use it on result page)

Implementation tasks (minimal diff, build-first)
1) Add StyleMode state (global)
   - StyleModeId = "standard" | "kawaii" | "oshi"
   - Persist to localStorage key: "oshihapi:style_mode"
   - Provide hook: useStyleMode() that reads/writes localStorage safely (client-only)
   - Default = "standard"

2) Home page: add StyleMode toggle
   - On app/page.tsx: add a clear section "表示スタイル" (or similar)
   - 3 options: 標準 / かわいい / 推し活用語
   - When changed: store in localStorage and keep for all pages.

3) Flow page: copy changes ONLY
   - On app/flow/page.tsx:
     - For each question, keep the same internal value keys used for evaluation.
     - Replace ONLY the displayed prompt/option labels using STYLE_COPY[styleMode].flow.questions[questionId].
   - IMPORTANT: Answer "value" sent into evaluation must remain unchanged.

4) Result page: explanation/advice/share copy changes
   - If result page already has mode toggle: keep it, but align to the same StyleMode global state (one source).
   - Show:
     - headline/explain from STYLE_COPY[styleMode].result
     - share template from STYLE_COPY[styleMode].result.shareTemplateX
   - Keep verdict/reasons/actions arrays unchanged.

5) Avoid confusion: rename existing "モードを選ぶ" (flow depth) label
   - Change that section title to something like: "診断の深さ（所要時間）"
   - Keep existing flow options (急いで/じっくり/AI相談) working as-is.

Verification / acceptance
- npm run build ✅
- Manual checks:
  1) Home: change StyleMode, navigate to flow, confirm question text changes.
  2) Complete a run: result page copy changes by StyleMode; verdict/reasons/actions stay identical.
  3) Reload: StyleMode persists.

Failure reporting
- If build fails: paste the first TypeScript error (file:line) and the build log tail.
- If UI mismatch: provide screenshot of home + flow + result with current mode selection.

Constraints
- Minimal diff, no broad refactors.
- PS: do NOT introduce randomness; keep any sticker selection deterministic if needed.
