PR Goal
- Expand QuestionBank to v4 branch architecture (core + addons) and make StyleMode visible end-to-end.
- MUST pass: npm run build ✅
- IMPORTANT invariants:
  - Do NOT change decision semantics for BUY/WAIT/SKIP, reasonTags meaning, nextActions meaning.
  - Option 'value' keys are LOGIC and must remain stable. Only labels/help/copy can differ by StyleMode.
  - Minimal diff, build-first, reversible.

Single source of truth
- docs/question_bank_v4_spec_latest.md
- src/oshihapi/modes/style_copy_dictionary.ts

Tasks
1) Fix build blockers if any (TypeScript parsing/encoding). Ensure style_copy_dictionary.ts compiles.
2) StyleMode global state
   - Add StyleModeId = "standard" | "kawaii" | "oshi"
   - Persist localStorage key: "oshihapi:style_mode"
   - Create a small client hook helper: src/oshihapi/modes/useStyleMode.ts (or similar)
3) HOME (app/page.tsx)
   - Add StyleMode toggle section using STYLE_COPY[mode].home
   - Keep existing FlowMode section but rename it to avoid confusion: "診断の深さ（所要時間）"
4) FLOW (app/flow/page.tsx)
   - Keep existing internal question ids / option values used by evaluation.
   - Render prompt/help/options labels from STYLE_COPY[mode].flow.questions[questionId]
   - Ensure answer submission uses the stable 'value'
   - Addons:
     - If itemType= ticket/gacha/preorder etc, include the addon questions defined in spec.
     - If current code doesn't have itemType in flow, add minimal way to set it from home selection or query param.
5) RESULT (app/result/[runId]/page.tsx)
   - Use STYLE_COPY[mode].result for headline/explain/share
   - verdict/reasons/actions must remain unchanged, only presentation changes
6) Verification
   - npm run build ✅
   - Manual:
     - Select StyleMode on home -> go to flow -> confirm question text changes
     - Complete run -> result copy changes by StyleMode, but verdict/reasons/actions content remains same
     - Reload -> StyleMode persists

If build fails
- Paste FIRST TypeScript error (file:line) and the build log tail.
