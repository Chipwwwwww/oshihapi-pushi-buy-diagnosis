# PR Goal
Change the anonymous telemetry section on the Result page so that price/name sending is OPT-IN (unchecked by default).
Currently the UI uses "価格を送らない / 商品名を送らない" with default checked.
We want default unchecked, while keeping privacy safe: unchecked means those fields are NOT sent.

# Context
- Next.js App Router + TypeScript
- Result page: app/result/[runId]/page.tsx (or a component it uses)
- Runs stored in localStorage; telemetry feature may exist already.
- Keep behavior stable; only adjust the telemetry UI defaults + payload composition.

# Requirements (MUST)
1) In the "学習のために匿名データを送信" section:
   - Replace checkboxes with opt-in labels:
     - 「価格を送る（任意）」 default unchecked
     - 「商品名を送る（任意）」 default unchecked
   - Add helper text (JP) clarifying:
     - 「チェックしない場合、価格・商品名は送信されません。」
2) Payload rules:
   - If user does NOT check "価格を送る", omit price from telemetry payload (undefined / null / do not include key).
   - If user does NOT check "商品名を送る", omit item name from telemetry payload.
   - If checked, include the value (if present). If the value is missing, still behave gracefully.
3) State defaults:
   - includePrice = false, includeItemName = false
   - Do NOT default to sending anything extra.
4) If there is persisted preference in localStorage (e.g. omitPrice/omitName):
   - Migrate safely or just set new defaults to false without breaking.
   - Prefer: new keys includePrice/includeItemName; fallback false.
5) Keep the rest of the page unchanged.

# Files to update (likely)
- app/result/[runId]/page.tsx
- Possibly a telemetry helper/component in components/ or src/oshihapi/
- If telemetry payload builder exists, update it accordingly.

# Acceptance criteria
- When opening Result page, both checkboxes are UNCHECKED.
- Clicking "匿名データを送信する" WITHOUT checking any box sends telemetry without price/name fields.
- Checking each box includes only that field.
- UI copy is Japanese and friendly; no confusing double-negatives.
