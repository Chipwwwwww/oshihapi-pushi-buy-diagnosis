[PR GOAL]
Fix desktop layout on result page WITHOUT changing mobile UI and WITHOUT refactoring structure.
Minimal diff. Must pass `npm run build`.

Context:
Current desktop layout feels "weird" when content stretches too wide. We want simple centered container + max width.
DO NOT introduce sticky sidebar, DO NOT extract reusable components, DO NOT reorder blocks.

Target file(s):
- app/result/[runId]/page.tsx (primary)
Optional (only if truly needed):
- components/DecisionScale.tsx (only to clamp width on desktop)

What to change (minimal):
1) Add a centered max-width wrapper for the whole result page content:
   - Use Tailwind like: `mx-auto w-full max-w-2xl md:max-w-3xl lg:max-w-4xl px-4 md:px-6`
   - Ensure mobile remains same (no desktop-only grid/sticky).

2) Clamp specific ultra-wide parts on desktop:
   - Hero summary block: add `max-w-3xl` (desktop) while keeping full width on mobile.
   - DecisionScale container: add `max-w-3xl` (desktop) to avoid an ultra-wide scale line.

3) Keep layout order EXACTLY the same:
   - Do not move "今すぐやる" card to sidebar.
   - Do not change the card grouping/stacking logic.
   - Only width/spacing constraints.

4) Acceptance:
   - On desktop (>=1024px), content is centered and not edge-to-edge.
   - On mobile, UI is unchanged.
   - `npm run build` passes.

Notes:
- No new components unless absolutely unavoidable.
- No CSS refactors. Use existing tokens/styles.
