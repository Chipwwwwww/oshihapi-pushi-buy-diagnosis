Codex PR Prompt: PMR hardening — reserved variable guard for PS5.1 ($PID / $Host) (minimal diff, build ✅)

Goal
- Prevent post_merge_routine.ps1 from crashing due to PowerShell 5.1 automatic read-only variables collisions.
- In PowerShell, variable names are case-insensitive: $pid == $PID, $host == $Host.
- Add a fail-fast preflight guard that detects dangerous variable names used in assignments and exits with a clear message BEFORE running stages.

Hard acceptance criteria
- npm run build ✅ (app)
- post_merge_routine.ps1 parse check passes in PS5.1
- Running .\post_merge_routine.ps1 does not throw "Cannot overwrite variable PID/Host" when the script contains no such assignments.

Scope (minimal diff)
1) Add a new preflight step early in PMR, before KILL_PORTS:
   - Scan the script text (Get-Content -Raw) for patterns of assignments to reserved vars:
     - `(?im)^\s*\$pid\s*=`  (covers $pid / $PID)
     - `(?im)^\s*\$host\s*=` (covers $host / $Host)
   - If found, print:
     - Stage label: RESERVED_VAR_GUARD
     - A clear error explaining case-insensitivity and why it's read-only
     - Recommended rename: $owningPid / $parityHost (or $targetHost)
   - Exit non-zero and generate the normal debug bundle + PMR AUTO SUMMARY.

2) (Optional) expand guard list to other confusing names:
   - param name "Args" / variable $args (warn-only is OK)

Validation
- Run parse check:
  `[ScriptBlock]::Create((Get-Content -Raw .\post_merge_routine.ps1 -Encoding UTF8)) | Out-Null`
- Run PMR normally and confirm it proceeds.
- (If you simulate bad content by temporarily inserting `$pid = 1`), guard should stop early with clear message, then roll back.

If failure
- Paste PMR AUTO SUMMARY
- Paste ops/pmr_debug_bundle_*.zip path

Notes
- Keep changes minimal and PS5.1 compatible; do not add PS7-only syntax.
