PR Goal
- Expand question bank toward v3 as defined in docs/question_bank_v3_spec_latest.md.
- Add missing questions (context/core/risk/addons) and route them by FlowMode + ItemType.
- Keep backward compatibility for old runs.
- Must pass: npm run build ✅

Rules
- At MVP, it is OK if evaluation logic stays mostly the same, BUT:
  - new questions must not break evaluation (missing answers allowed)
  - if you wire new questions into evaluate(), do it additively and safely

Implementation (recommended safe approach)
1) Question definitions
   - Create/extend a question list structure (ids + option values)
   - Ensure option values match those in src/oshihapi/modes/style_copy_dictionary.ts

2) Routing
   - quick: max 5
   - standard: ~12
   - deep: include risk + addons (max ~20-26)
   - ItemType adds addons:
     - ticket/gacha/preorder/figure/digital

3) Evaluation compatibility
   - Ensure evaluate() handles missing keys
   - Keep reasonTags semantics unchanged
   - If you add new scoring, map to existing tags:
     budget/urgency/market/space/impulse/duplicate/use/regret/risk

Acceptance
- build ✅
- UI shows the expanded question bank in deep mode
- old runId renders without crash
