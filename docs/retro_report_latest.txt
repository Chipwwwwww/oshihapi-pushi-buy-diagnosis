[retro] 2026-02-13

Root issues:
1) "Mode" word collision:
   - HOME already had FlowMode ("急いで/じっくり/AI相談"), user expected StyleMode (standard/kawaii/oshi).
2) Spec/dictionary existed but feature not wired across HOME->flow->result, so user couldn't see it.
3) Local != Vercel/Codex because remote push/branch/host config not guaranteed.

Fix direction:
- Separate FlowMode vs StyleMode explicitly in UI and docs.
- Add StyleMode toggle on HOME, persist to localStorage, apply to flow & result copy.
- Keep decision logic invariant at MVP; change only copy.

Artifacts delivered:
- docs/mode_copy_spec_latest.md
- src/oshihapi/modes/style_copy_dictionary.ts
- docs/codex_prompt_expand_questionbank_and_stylemode_fullstack_20260213.txt (copied to clipboard)

SOP reminder:
- After merge: push -> post_merge_routine -> verify parity (if configured) -> UI check.
